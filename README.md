House Price Prediction using Linear Regression:


This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, age of the property, and location. The project includes several preprocessing techniques such as One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling, and Data Normalization to prepare the dataset before training the model.


Overview:
_________
This repository demonstrates the use of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices. The key steps in the project are:

*Data preprocessing using One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
*Feature scaling to normalize the data.
*Building and training a Linear Regression model from the scikit-learn library.
*Evaluating model performance using metrics like MSE and R² score.

The dataset used for this project can be found at kaagle
or can be generated synthetically. It consists of 1460rows and 81 columns, including both input features and the target variable (Price).


Preprocessing:
______________
To prepare the dataset for the Linear Regression model, several preprocessing steps are applied:

1. Handling Missing Data
Missing values in the dataset (if any) are handled using methods like mean/mode/median imputation.

2. One-Hot Encoding
Categorical features like Location are transformed into numerical values using One-Hot Encoding. For example:

 
3. Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is used to normalize the numerical data. We use StandardScaler from scikit-learn to standardize the features:

4. Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. Typically, 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% for testing.

5. Feature Selection
The most relevant features are selected to improve model performance. Feature importance can be evaluated using various techniques.

Dependencies:
_____________
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
The scikit-learn library contains the LinearRegression module used to create and train the linear regression model.

Usage:
______
Prepare the dataset by either downloading it or using the synthetic dataset. Ensure it’s saved as a .csv file in the data/ directory.

You can evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and visualize the results through plots generated by the script.

Results:
_________
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Additionally, you can visualize the results by plotting the actual vs predicted values or using other relevant visualizations.
